# R Random Forest on Crub Violence Analysis?

This study investigates factors influencing violent crime rates across U.S. states from the 1970s to 2000s by analyzing data on violent incidents and various social variables, including population, density, income, law, and racial demographics. Using **linear regression and random forest models**, the study compares their ability to predict violent crime, identifying which predictors significantly influence the crime rate. The linear regression model considers all variables, while the random forest model highlights population and the percentage of Caucasians as the most influential predictors.

The dataset contains crime data across 50 states and Washington, D.C., with social factors like income, population, and law. The random forest model divides the data into decision trees, evaluating the impact of each predictor by Mean Decrease Accuracy (IncMSE). Both linear regression and random forest models are evaluated using RMSE and R-squared scores to measure accuracy. Results suggest that linear regression, with an RMSE of 101.47 and R-squared of 0.91, fits better than random forest, which scored 162.18 and 0.76, respectively.

Despite limitations, including potential missing data and the dataset’s timeframe, the study concludes that population and racial demographics strongly correlate with violent crime rates. The findings underscore the need for more recent data and suggest considering external social factors for a comprehensive understanding of violent crime. The study’s approach offers insights into state-level factors impacting crime rates, informing public safety and policy discussions.
